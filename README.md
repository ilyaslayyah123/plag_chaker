# PlagChaker

PlagChaker is a plagiarism detection tool that checks the similarity between two text files by analyzing their content and structure. The tool utilizes a linked list data structure and implements a merge sort algorithm to efficiently compare and rank similarities.

## Features

- Reads and preprocesses text files.
- Converts text into a linked list representation.
- Sorts linked lists for efficient comparison.
- Calculates the similarity percentage between two texts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
